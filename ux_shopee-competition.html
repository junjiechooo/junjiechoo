                                <p>To change user behavior, motivating them towards being environmentally friendly.</p><br>

                                <h4>User Research</h4>
                                <h5>Primary research:</h5>
                                <p>According to survey results published by Mediacorp in 2019, young adults have the strongest concern regarding the issue of global warming and many of them indicated “agreed” or “strongly agreed” on the willingness to contribute their part to the environment (Elangovan, 2019). As I am working on an initiative to tackle the issue of climate change among housewives, working adults, and undergraduate students, I seek to understand their perspectives and opinions on climate change through primary and secondary research.
                                We interviewed these three main groups: housewife, working adult and undergraduates. <br><br>
                                Through the statistics, we decided to conduct a deeper observation by conducting a secondary observation through a survey for the young adults to better understand our potential target audience.</p><br>
                            
                                <h5>Secondary research:</h5>
                                <p>Through the statistics, I decided to conduct a deeper observation by conducting a secondary observation through a survey for young adults to better understand our potential target audience.
                                The survey results actually showed a similar trend with the online statistics that the majority of young adults are concerned for the environment. The surveyed audiences are already, in fact, making an improvement, 99% are already doing their part for the environment (e.g recycling minimally on a monthly basis). <br><br>
                                ​
                                Through the statistics and data collected, I have identified and drilled down their concerns into the different breakdowns in the following section.</p><br>

                                <h4>Persona</h4>
                                <p>Using the results I got from the User Surveys & Interviews I created User Personas to represent the common needs and wants of the audience. This is something I will then be able to keep referring to throughout the design phase.</p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 5%;">Based on all the feedback, amendments were made to the design taking into account accessibility, I therefore created a style guide so any future changes that may need to be made can follow these guidelines and keep consistency in the design.</p>

                                <h4>Product Specification</h4>
                                <p>These new features aim to implement it gradually as it would require time for the tech department to model products from shopee sellers who wish to increase conversions and decrease the return rate of buyers . Using 3D modelling of the product will allow users to be able to have a feel and look at how the product will look like on them before purchasing it. Another way to get product modelled will be to engage with 3D product model company such as Style.me, NBYIT.</p>

                                <p>In addition, with the avatar details such as height, weight, and size of the body, there will be an automatic recommendation for sizing which will aid users in selecting the size that will mostly suit them. The recommendation of the size is purely based on the history of buyers with the same avatar details. For instance, for a clothes of size M fits users with the avatar weight ranging from 60 - 65 kilograms, height ranging from 170 - 175 centimeters, average body size and average body shape. This feature was further improved from ASOS fit assistant 4 .</p>
                                    
                                <p>Lastly, we also incorporate the idea of having Augmented Reality cameras for users to place virtual objects in any specific area they wish to see how the product can fit in the space. We also implemented screenshot capability for users to share or save the image compare it with other alternative products they intend to purchase. This allows users to be able to plan their purchase well as the size of the product is exactly the same.</p>

                                <p>What Shopee does: Marketplace for regional sellers and buyers</p>
                                <p>As the target audience is the layman, it would be helpful having more visual elements rather than specifications. Taking clothings for example, having models wearing the clothes, alongside clothing specification, is insufficient for consumers to visualise themselves in the same clothes. Similarly, furniture are larger items around the house, making it difficult to visualise how the new furniture could complement the existing ones. Noting the competitive landscape, AR technology is not widely used in the market currently.</p>
                                    
                                <p>Although some applications have this feature already, such as IKEA Place, by implementing the use of AR, this allows Shopee to be one step ahead of their competitors as consumers would feel more secure about how they look like in the clothes of their choice, or how the furniture would fit in their houses. With a further customization of an avatar, this allows consumers to feel more connected and that the app is personalised.</p>
                                    
                                <p>By adding the AR feature with a personalised touch, this would help Shopee become a one-stop solution , increasing customer retention rate and help Shopee grow and stay relevant.</p>

                                <h4 style="margin-top: 5%;">Limitations and Constraints</h4>
                                <p>Due to Covid-19, we no longer conduct face to face interview.  Nevertheless, it was a fresh experience to online interviewing doing for user testing. Thanks to Figma, interviewees are allowed to access to our prototype with the given link. We also managed to video record their use of the application throughout the testing.</p>

                                <h4 style="margin-top: 5%;">Learnings & Future Plans</h4>
                                <p>Even though AI/AR is the next new features for E-commerce, it may require the company to hire people which these skills which might incur a high cost to come up with another developer team. I learned that I should also consider the feasibility of the project based on the company current ability and not to go too far stretch. I should also take into account of their company's finances so that they would not need to incur too much cost.</p><hr>
